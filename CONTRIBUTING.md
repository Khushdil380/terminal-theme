## üé® Contributing Themes

### Creating a New Theme

1. Copy an existing theme from `themes/` directory
2. Rename it to your theme name (e.g., `my-awesome-theme.json`)
3. Modify the JSON configuration:
   ```json
   {
     "name": "My Awesome Theme",
     "description": "Brief description of your theme",
     "version": "1.0.0",
     "prompt_symbol": "symbol:chevron",
     "prompt_symbol_color": "#ffffff",
     "blocks": [ ... ]
   }
   ```
4. Test with `Set-PSTheme my-awesome-theme`
5. Take a screenshot for the preview

### Theme Design Guidelines

- **Readability**: Ensure text is readable in both light and dark terminals
- **Consistency**: Use consistent color schemes throughout blocks
- **Accessibility**: Consider users with color vision differences
- **Performance**: Avoid overly complex icons that might slow rendering
- **Compatibility**: Test on Windows Terminal, VS Code, and PowerShell ISE

## üß© Contributing Modules

### Creating New Block Modules

1. Create a new file in `modules/` directory (e.g., `battery.ps1`)
2. Implement the required function:
   ```powershell
   function Get-BatteryBlock {
       param(
           [object]$Config,
           [object]$ThemeConfig
       )
       
       # Your block logic here
       return @{
           Text = "Battery: 85%"
           Color = $Config.foreground
           BackgroundColor = $Config.background
       }
   }
   ```
3. Update theme files to include your new block
4. Test thoroughly
